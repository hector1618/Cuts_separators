# Basic functions

Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for finding minimum cut
Find Open Neighbourhood for given set S
Find Closed Neighbourhood for given set S
Check whether the set is connected or not
For given R, find \delta(R) which is set of edges with exactly one end point in R.


# More specialized functions

Given two sets, find important seperator of the size at most k
Given two sets, list important seperators of the size at most k
Given graph G, set A, check whether A is (q, k) unbreakable or not.
Given graph G, set A if (q, k) is breakable, output witnessing seperators.
Given graph G and set S, find set C of all the inlusion wise maximal chips.
Give two chips C1 and C2, find do they touch each others or now.
